# Game-2048
Implemented "2048" game in Java using Swing GUI. Allowed movement with arrow keys, merging adjacent tiles with matching numbers. Added lose condition when no further moves possible. Developed item list display component in TypeScript/Angular, fetching related items on selection using Ionic's ion-item-sliding.
